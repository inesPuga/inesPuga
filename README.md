# 👋 Hi, I’m Inês Puga

I’m from **Portugal** and work as a **Software Engineer**.  
💻 Passionate about **learning new things** and **collaborating with others** to build meaningful projects.  

⚽ Outside of programming, you’ll often find me:  
- Playing **soccer** or coaching **futsal** 🏆  
- Riding my **bike** 🚴  
- Listening to **music** 🎶  

I enjoy both **learning** and **teaching**, which is why I also coach and share knowledge with others.
