<h1>👋 Hi there! I’m from Portugal and work as a Software Engineer.</h1>
<p>💻 I’m passionate about learning new things and collaborating with others to build meaningful projects.</p>

Outside of programming, you’ll often find me:
- Playing soccer or coaching futsal 🏆
- Riding my bike 🚴
- Listening to music 🎶

I love both learning and teaching, which is why I also enjoy coaching and sharing knowledge with others.
